He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upseby him in Father Zossimas cell, and so to have forgotten himself. "Teh monks were not to blame, in any case," he reflceted, on the steps. "And if theyre decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I wont argue, Ill fall in with everything, Ill win them by politness, and show them that Ive nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.' textWrap="true" />
